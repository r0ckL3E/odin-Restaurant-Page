# odin-Restaurant-Page

This web application dynamically generates and displays content on a webpage using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, bundled with Webpack. The template.html file provides the basic structure of the webpage, including meta tags for character set and viewport settings, links to Google Fonts and an external CSS file (styles.css), and a navigation bar with buttons for "Home," "Menu," and "About." The styles.css file defines the styles for the webpage, including global styles, header styles, navigation button styles, and content padding. The about.js file dynamically creates and appends a paragraph and a heading element to the #content div, providing a narrative about a character named Carmen. Similarly, home.js and menu.js are responsible for generating and appending content specific to the "Home" and "Menu" sections, respectively. Webpack is used to bundle these JavaScript files, ensuring efficient loading and modularity. This setup allows for a dynamic and interactive user experience, with content being generated and styled on the fly based on user interactions.
